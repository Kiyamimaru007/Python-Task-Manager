# Python-Task-Manager

This is a task manager program with a user login. A user would login as an ordinary user or an admin.
The normal user and admin would have seperate Menus and thus seperate 'powers'. The program added, edited and removed tasks.
The program also kept track of task due dates. The admin would be able to add new users. The program would accept a username and password for login.
The challenge here is that the database is in the form of a .txt file. The code had to be written in a way that it could accurately search, read and manipulate the data.
This was coded in Python.
